I am currently a postdoctoral scholar working under the guidance of Prof. Jorge Cort√©s at University of California, San Diego. I received my Ph.D in Engineering Sciences (Mechanical Engineering) from University of California, San Diego in 2022.

Our research is mainly focused on creating theoretically principled data-driven methods to learn dynamical behavior. We use tools from operator theory, system identification, learning methods, and control theory.
